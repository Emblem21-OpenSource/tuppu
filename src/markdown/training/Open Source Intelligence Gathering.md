--> [The events at Portland today involving Andy Ngo](https://twitter.com/Jimryan015/status/1145067852375851008) have made it abundantly clear that [city officials](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/14/ted-wheeler-portland-mayor-stands-decision-allow-a/), [foreign money](https://archive.fo/QLZ0v), [police chiefs](https://archive.fo/JG4zc), [federal law officials](https://archive.fo/AMDyy), and [entrenched political families in the West Coast](https://archive.fo/7KviH) are pulling the strings for a widespread intimidation strategy in advance of the 2020 elections.  Anyone expecting militias, citizens, police, private contractors, journalists, moral leaders, thought leaders, or any part of the American legal system to effectively counter the actions of these hopelessly brainwashed and violent mobs is not only a fool, but has intentionally lived a sheltered life where they actively avoid ever being targeted by such intimidation.  Many of us have spent years adapting to round-the-clock watch by the leftist media opportunists, federal panopticon surveillance, and Silicon Valley twerps who think abuse their positions for Right Side of History points.  It's time to put that training to use and start implementing Gnostic Warfare tactics to target the AIs that power Antifa.

## What is Gnostic Warfare?

--> [Gnostic Warfare](/2018/06/02/Gnostic-Warfare/) is a holistic analysis of attack vectors focused on compromising the common elements shared between multiple modes of cognition.  This means exploring the weaknesses of Kurweilian singularities, posthuman neurochimera, hiveminds, and neural network ecosystems.  Those weakness start with a human operator whose work is essential to the performance of various gnostic constructs.  Once the operator is discovered, they can be made to influence the results of a machine learning process, a data science policy, or a data lake query.  In the context of Antifa, they unknowingly rely on a large number of AI policies that assist them in their violence.  (Often unofficially state sanctioned)

--> For example, employees at Google not only sympathize with Antifa, but they actively provide material assistance and information assets to help them.  Such employees might tweak algorithms to provide favoritism in search results, ad filtering, and intentionally watering down facial recognition technology to protect individual members. Identifying such employees would be tremendously helpful in cutting Antifa off from corporate sponsorship.

--> Google isn't the only backer of Antifa.  They also have help from [powerful corporations](https://archive.fo/EoNAs) and [well-funded political machines](https://archive.fo/ErZ2D).  Each of these backers provide money, training, and intelligence support for Antifa.  Each supporter has dependencies on artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, and data science.  The goal is to identify where those gnostic constructs exist and then undermine them.  With this training, you will be able to identify the means of corruption used by public officials, detect money laundering between shadow players, use metadata and signals analysis to discover ineffective law enforcement practices that favor Antifa, and uncover the bribes of dishonest journalists.

--> In short, with Gnostic Warfare training, you will go from targeted pro-nationalism supporters on the fringe to the feared internal affairs division of the upcoming Robotic Nationalist order.

## Overview

--> Detecting gnostic constructs within a network means identifying information about the people in that network.  This means seeing a group of people and how they are related as a puzzle to solve.  A person is a data point that contains unknown properties you have to discover.  As you build up facts about data points, you can connect them together to establish a network.  Once the shape of the network appears, you can identify the location of gnostic constructs and then act to compromise them.

--> To get started, you're going to have to get a crash course on [Open Source Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (OSINT) techniques.  This means you're going to have to learn how to deal with Linux and Python.  These are easy things to do now.  Consider the learning of these tools as no different than spending time on a range or learning self-defense techniques.  You're also going to have to learn how to think about what is known and what is unknown when exploring human networks.

## Strategy

--> You're not targeting individual Antifa.  That's pointless.  You are examining their money, influence, logistics, and coordination networks for bottlenecks, core nodes, and weak spots.  That means understanding how people are related to one another and what services and goods they provide the rest of the network.  This lets you capture their network and turn it into a resource instead of an adversary.

--> It's not enough to say "*them*" or "*the enemy*".  Antifa support networks are made up of people who have data, facts, names, addresses, illegal habits, contracts, and weaknesses you have to identify.  As investigators, you're job is to answer every unknown question about a person you can conceive of and collect facts that back up your answers.

--> You will be operating in publicly observable channels that Antifa is most likely monitoring.  To ensure maximum operational security and reusability under these conditions, organize yourselves according to this modified approach to scientific methodology:

### Programmer

--> Many of you will have to be your own Programmers at first.  You'll have to try out a variety of scrapers and API integrations to perform basic investigation tasks.  You may also have to keep such code up to date.   You may also end up creating custom tooling as well.  Be sure to share your tools and tricks with one another.

### Investigator

--> Investigators use intelligence gathering tools to collect facts about people.  They are the front line in confirming and updating the identity, properties, and relationships of people.  To maximize operational security, investigators should only be asked to collect facts about one person at a time without any context of why the person is being investigated.  This allows an operation to deploy ready-made intelligence gathering suites to a wide variety of isolated investigators without requiring trust.  With this approach, you could then use Fiverr or Mechanical Turk or other cheap crowdsourcing services to act as investigators.  Investigators should be creating "**proposals**", which means storing their accumulating their facts and data points into publicly accessible lists, databases, or visualizations.

### Analyst

--> Analysts create, discover, curate, and search investigators and their proposals to fulfill inquiries with "**theories**".  They also act as quality assurance for investigators to confirm facts are accurate.  While neither investigators or analysts should be overly concerned with implied contexts that will arise from data points are related, it is useful at times to use such implied contexts as guides to ask additional questions about proposals to improve their accuracy.  Analysts should spend time finding investigators and learn how to assess proposals for quality and reliability.

### Enquirer

--> An Enquirer provides the context of an inquiry.  Enquirers should be able to discover analysts and rank the theories they produce exclusively based on "**insight**".  Often, we will not be able to conform to the predictability focus of scientific methodology as repeatably exploitable gnostic assets will be few.  Instead, insights recognize how a collection of theories revealed a pathway to an exploitable gnostic construct.  When gnostic constructs are identified, they should be intrinsically treated as high value assets with extreme time-sensitivity.  In addition to discovering Analysts, Enquirers should also be able to find each other and aggressive rate one anothers performance by sharing the chain of proposals that lead the theories that yielded insights.  This *proof-of-insight* mechanism eliminates infiltrators and LARPers, allowing enquirers to identify themselves as pragmatically valuable to one another.  Enquirers will piece all of this together to create **vectors**, a description of how gnostic constructs were detected and recommendations on how to compromise them.

## Training

As mentioned previously, no matter where you are in the organization, you will have to train yourself to git gud, so get to it.

#### Technical

Let's get the technical out of the way.  While Ubuntu is a good starting point to get familiar with the basics with the least amount of concern, you are free to use any distribution of Linux you want.

* [Learn Ubuntu Terminal](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#6): Ubuntu is easy and you might be a noob, so learn Terminal basics quickly.
* [Learn Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science):  Python is easy.
* [Basic scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k): Learn how to scape data with Python.

### Intelligence Gathering

Intelligence gathering tools are used to answer unknown facts about a data point.  These tools can be used to investigate and confirm the validity of a fact.

* [Facebook Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US): The Ad Library provides advertising transparency by offering a comprehensive, searchable collection of all ads currently running from across Facebook Products. Anyone can explore the Library, with or without a Facebook account.  This can be used to see where advertising is being used to attract and coordinate Antifa.
* [SnapStory](https://github.com/sdushantha/SnapStory): Scrape public stories from SnapChats.  Useful for gathering intelligence on Antifa nodes using SnapChat.
* [Entro.py](https://github.com/andrew-vii/Entro.py): Monitors chat status activity of Facebook uses to know when they are on their device and when they are not.
* [InstaLooter](https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter): Quickly scrape all Instagram photos from a person.
* [SpiderFoot](https://spiderfoot.net/hx/): SpiderFoot is a reconnaissance tool that automatically queries over 100 public data sources to gather intelligence on IP addresses, domain names, e-mail addresses, names and more.  When combined with basic emoji replacement attacks (self-hosted images used in private chats that look like an emoji but give you the IP address of people who see them), this can be incredibly useful at identifying people from an IP address alone.
* [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition): Useful when paired with image scrapers to identify people in videos and images.
* [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) - Generate username lists from companies on LinkedIn.
* [Universal Reddit Scraper](https://github.com/JosephLai241/Universal-Reddit-Scraper): This is a universal Reddit scraper where you can manually specify subreddits to scrape, specify which category of posts to scrape for each subreddit, and how many results are returned.
* [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint): Twint is an advanced Twitter scraping tool written in Python that allows for scraping Tweets from Twitter profiles without using Twitter's API.
* [Citadel](https://github.com/jakecreps/Citadel): Curated list of vetted and useful OSINT tools.
* [PwnBin](https://github.com/kahunalu/pwnbin): PwnBin is a webcrawler which searches public pastebins for specified keywords. 
* [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock): Find a username across multiple social media networks.
* [SkipTracer](https://github.com/xillwillx/skiptracer): Get basic PII on a target from paywall sites.

### Visualization

Visualization of how facts and data points are connected is very important.  Visualizations help you see what is known and what is unknown.  The goal of any investigator is to be able to generate a visualization of a human network that is unable to produce additional questions about itself.

* [Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.com/): A useful tool to build graphs that detail and share the relationships between people, organizations, and data.
* [Milanote](https://milanote.com/): A useful tool to build graphs that also lets you link to other public Milanote graphs.
* [Draw.io](https://draw.io/): A basic diagramming tool.

## Notes

* I've left operational recommendations out of this summary for now because it will be important for each layer to develop their own relevant resilience against infiltrators and bad practices.
* Proposals and theories should be 100% self-contained in the event that analysts and investigators go dark.
* This is a human resource operation for now.  I can develop tools to streamline everything based on how interactions are evolving.
* To prevent Enquirers from hoarding vectors, their time-sensitive nature will be important.  This forces Enquirers to leverage vectors before the shape of the network evolves. (personnel changes, software patches, policy changes, etc.)
* This structure is designed for a fast and iterative evolution towards efficiency so that counterintelligence forces end up creating louder and larger identification signals as they keep up.

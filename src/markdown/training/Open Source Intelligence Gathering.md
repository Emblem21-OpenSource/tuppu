--> [The events at Portland today involving Andy Ngo](https://twitter.com/Jimryan015/status/1145067852375851008) have made it abundantly clear that [city officials](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/14/ted-wheeler-portland-mayor-stands-decision-allow-a/), [foreign money](https://archive.fo/QLZ0v), [police chiefs](https://archive.fo/JG4zc), [federal law officials](https://archive.fo/AMDyy), and [entrenched powerful families in the West Coast](https://archive.fo/7KviH) are pulling the strings.  Expecting militias, citizens, police, private contractors, or any edge of the American legal system to effectively counter these hopelessly brainwashed and violent mobs is an impossible proposition.  This is a problem to demonstrate the practical applications of Gnostic Warfare.

--> These people don't spontaneously appear of their own volition.  They have help from [powerful corporations](https://archive.fo/EoNAs) and [well-funded political machines](https://archive.fo/ErZ2D).  Each of these supporters contribute major money, material, connections, training, and intelligence to assist Antifa.  Each have reliances on artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, and data science to assist in the coordination of their stategy.  The goal is to identify where AI is being used and then compromise those nodes.

# Getting Started

--> To get started, you're going to have to get a crash course on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques.  Here's a handy list of resources you can go through to train yourself.

## Technical

* [Learn Ubuntu Terminal](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#6): Ubuntu is easy and you might be a noob, so learn Terminal.
* [Learn Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science):  It's easy, stop being lazy.
* [Basic scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k): Learn how to scape data with Python.

## Intelligence Gathering

* [Facebook Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US): The Ad Library provides advertising transparency by offering a comprehensive, searchable collection of all ads currently running from across Facebook Products. Anyone can explore the Library, with or without a Facebook account.  This can be used to see where advertising is being used to attract and coordinate Antifa.
* [SnapStory](https://github.com/sdushantha/SnapStory): Scrape public stories from SnapChats.  Useful for gathering intelligence on Antifa nodes using SnapChat.
* [Entro.py](https://github.com/andrew-vii/Entro.py): Monitors chat status activity of Facebook uses to know when they are on their device and when they are not.
* [InstaLooter](https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter): Quickly scrape all Instagram photos from a person.
* [SpiderFoot](https://spiderfoot.net/hx/): SpiderFoot is a reconnaissance tool that automatically queries over 100 public data sources to gather intelligence on IP addresses, domain names, e-mail addresses, names and more.  When combined with basic emoji replacement attacks (self-hosted images used in private chats that look like an emoji but give you the IP address of people who see them), this can be incredibly useful at identifying people from an IP address alone.
* [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition): Useful when paired with image scrapers to identify people in videos and images.
* [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) - Generate username lists from companies on LinkedIn.
* [Universal Reddit Scraper](https://github.com/JosephLai241/Universal-Reddit-Scraper): This is a universal Reddit scraper where you can manually specify subreddits to scrape, specify which category of posts to scrape for each subreddit, and how many results are returned.
* [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint): Twint is an advanced Twitter scraping tool written in Python that allows for scraping Tweets from Twitter profiles without using Twitter's API.
* [Citadel](https://github.com/jakecreps/Citadel): Curated list of vetted and useful OSINT tools.
* [PwnBin](https://github.com/kahunalu/pwnbin): PwnBin is a webcrawler which searches public pastebins for specified keywords. 
* [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock): Find a username across multiple social media networks.
* [SkipTracer](https://github.com/xillwillx/skiptracer): Get basic PII on a target from paywall sites.

## Visualization

* [Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.com/): A useful tool to build graphs that detail and share the relationships between people, organizations, and data.
* [Milanote](https://milanote.com/): A useful tool to build graphs that also lets you link to other public Milanote graphs.

## Strategy

--> You're not targeting individual Antifa.  That's pointless.  You are examining their money, influence, logistics, and coordination networks for bottlenecks, core nodes, and weak spots.  That means understanding how people are related to one another and what services and goods they provide the rest of the network.  This lets you capture their network and use it for your ends.

--> It's not enough to say "them" or "the enemy".  Antifa support networks are made up of people who have names, addresses, illegal habits, contracts, and weaknesses you have to identify.  As you discover these people, you will also identify machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence dependencies within the network where Gnostic Warfare tactics can be used to poison the entire network undetected.

--> To ensure maximum operational security and reusability, organize yourselves according to these tasks:

### Enquirer

--> An Enquirer asks Analysts questions about graphs.  Requesters should be able to discover Analysts easily.  As Requesters become familiar with how to navigate graphs through Analysts, they'll be able to identify critical relationships and inflict significant damage to actual coordination networks.

### Analyst

--> Analysts create, discover, curate, and search graphs to fulfill requests.  They also create propositions about how graph data fulfills requests.  As long as Analysts can discover Collectors, they don't have to be part of any or one "group" or "chat" or "board".

### Collector

--> Collectors deploy information gathering resources to confirm the identity, properties, and relationships to update and provide insight into the graphs created by Analysts.  Collectors should not be given any context about the request.  Instead, they should simply be given people to collect data on.  This allows an operation you to scale out information gathering tools and training materials easily to many Collectors without requiring too much trust in them.  You could use Fiverr or Mechanical Turk or other cheap crowdsourcing services.  Collectors produce information for Analysts.

### Programmer

--> Programmers can keep scrapers and API integration code up to date as well as create custom tooling for Collectors and Analysts.

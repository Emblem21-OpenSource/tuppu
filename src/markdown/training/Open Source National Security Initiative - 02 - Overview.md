# Overview

* Demonstrate why now is the best possible time for Open Source National Security Initiative.
* Provide context and motivation to identify and extract under-leveraged civilian intelligence assets.
* Provide a comprehensive technical, intelligence, security, and organizational training regime to maximize investigative and analytical performance.
* Identify entry-level targets for assets to confirm the fidelity of the training regime.
* Generate pre-made technical packages and organizational platforms to simplify investigative and analytical performance and scale.
* Foster the open transmission of effective technique, technology, and resource sharing.
* Identify key nodes of Big Tech organizations with proximity to AI platforms.
* Identify AI policies and training being used to assist Antifa.
* Identify the source of those AI policy implementations.
* Identify ways to disrupt, deny, undermine, adjust, or capture operational efficiency of pro-Antifa AI policies.

## Recruitment Overview

* Corporate interests requires an infinite supply of cheap labor to fulfill employment mandates from government pressures, profit/dividend pressures from shareholders, and social justice pressures from long-term mass media cultural conditioning.
* These interests drive aggressive immigration policies for cheap labor which is reducing opportunity for competent programmers and knowledge workers who don't conform to social justice advocacy.
* Nationalist backlash from 2008 has driven corporations to back socialist enforcers in a desperate attempt to keep cheap labor flowing, resulting in nearly every single major Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 United State presidential election campaign to openly advocate for some variant of basic income.  Basic income policies will ensure a rapid, "guilt-free" acceleration of knowledge worker displacement in favor of cheap (and often incompetent) knowledge workers.
* Socialist enforcers will continue to receive corporate backing to ramp up the incarceration, imprisonment, legal intimidating, and social elimination of anyone who demonstrates a threat to cheap labor access.
* These pressures, when combined, will create a massive pool of talent to pick from for the Open Source National Security Initiative.
* Additionally, geopolitical pressures that contribute to the raising of interest rates will significantly disrupt corporate profits, resulting in large scale layoffs of knowledge workers.
* These displaced knowledge workers will possess valuable information regarding legacy systems and organizational habits of Big Tech.

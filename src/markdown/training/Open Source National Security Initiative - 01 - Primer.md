--> [The events at Portland today involving Andy Ngo](https://twitter.com/Jimryan015/status/1145067852375851008) have made it abundantly clear that [city officials](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/14/ted-wheeler-portland-mayor-stands-decision-allow-a/), [foreign money](https://archive.fo/QLZ0v), [police chiefs](https://archive.fo/JG4zc), [federal law officials](https://archive.fo/AMDyy), and [entrenched political families in the West Coast](https://archive.fo/7KviH) are pulling the strings for a widespread intimidation strategy in advance of the 2020 elections.  Anyone expecting militias, citizens, police, private contractors, journalists, moral figures, thought leaders, or any part of the American legal system to effectively counter the actions of these hopelessly brainwashed and violent mobs is not only a fool, but has intentionally lived a sheltered life where they actively avoid ever being targeted by such intimidation.  Many of us have spent years adapting to the round-the-clock watch by leftist media opportunists, federal panopticon surveillance, and Silicon Valley twerps who abuse their positions for Right Side of History points.  It's time to put that training to use and start implementing Gnostic Warfare tactics to target the AIs that power Antifa.

## What is Antifa?

--> Antifa is not a "grass-roots" movement.  It's not a reaction against anti-fascism.  Antifa is the manifestion of Chris Hedges, the 2014 harbinger of the [professional revolutionist](https://archive.fo/Ll8sI).  Yes, Antifa has a storied history in Europe, but what happened between pre-WW2 and now?  Did Antifa motivations take a seventy year vacation just because the Americans and Russians forced Germany to surrender?  Of course not.  *Antifa* is not a philosophy... it is a tactic.

--> In 2008, the powers that be determined [stealing all of our land](https://archive.fo/UIHnx#selection-437.1-437.532) and [bailing out foriengers over US citizens](https://archive.fo/9qXWW#selection-991.0-1013.68) was the way to recovery.  This means that the United States became a vassal of the globalization it expended ludicrous amounts of military assets to secure.  To ensure perpetual vassalization, domestic enforcement is required and Antifa is one of several candidates contending to be the primary means of that enforcement.  If you have objections to [corporations lobbying to redirect your healthcare contributions into non-citizen cheap labor as a sign-on bonus](https://archive.fo/5YpOY), Antifa is angling to be one of several models of last-stop enforcement to be deployed to ensure policy compliance.

## What is Gnostic Warfare?

--> [Gnostic Warfare](/2018/06/02/Gnostic-Warfare/) is a holistic analysis of attack vectors focused on compromising the common elements shared between multiple modes of cognition.  This means exploring the weaknesses of Kurweilian singularities, posthuman neurochimera, hiveminds, and neural network ecosystems. (I'll refer to these as "*gnostic constructs*" from here on out)  I'm very certain you are currently unable to connect the relationships between these mythical congitive constructs and Antifa, but hear me out because the connection is there.

--> Employees within Silicon Valley sympathize heavily with Antifa and act on that sympathy in the [form of material assistance, intelligence support, and coordination](https://archive.fo/GNoMF).  Such employees might:

* Tweak algorithms to provide favoritism in search results.
* Heavily favor ad placement for Antifa-friendly parties.
* Intentionally watering down facial recognition technology to protect individual Antifa members.
* Altering or hiding data requested by law enforcement that might identify core Antifa leadership.
* Providing blackmail from their massive data collection operations on police chiefs, police unions, and city officials to reduce law enforcement effectiveness.
 
--> With such corporate backing, sympathetic tech workers are most certainly tuning their AI strategies to provide support their Antifa comrades.  Identifying such technical favoritism means cutting off identifiying the employees around those AI products.

--> Google isn't the only backer of Antifa.  They also have help from [powerful corporations](https://archive.fo/EoNAs) and [well-funded political machines](https://archive.fo/ErZ2D).  Each of these backers provide money, training, and intelligence support for Antifa.  Each of these supporters have dependencies on artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, and data science.  The goal is to identify how Silicon Valley is utilizing these *gnostic constructs* and then undermining them.  With the training review, you will be able to identify corrupt public officials, detect money laundering between shadow players, identify weaknesses of sympathetic billionaires and corporate board members, use metadata and signals analysis to discover ineffective law enforcement practices that favor Antifa, and uncover the bribes of dishonest journalists... *all from targeting the AI ecosystems of several companies*.

## Why focus on AI over political battlegrounds or street demonstrations?

The dream of every social justice princeling is to have an army of perfectly loyal machines ensuring reality complies to their moral framework.  Low maintenance, low energy costs, and low feedback is exactly the type of enforcement schedule that social justice advocates yearn for.  Therefore, social justice at peak efficiency requires gnostic constructs as enforcers, first as a [policy of nudging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)), then as [social enforcers](https://archive.fo/t37SJ), then as [physical goons](https://builtin.com/robotics/police-robot-law-enforcement).

[AI security does not exist](https://archive.fo/OVl6B) and those working on it are mired in a [naive monoculture that can be fractured](/2013/08/14/the-theory-of-fracturing-monocultures/).  Every weakness in these princeling fantasies of total control starts with a human operator whose work is essential for the performance of various gnostic constructs.  Once the operator is discovered, they can be made to influence the results of a machine learning process, a data science policy, or a data lake query.  Antifa unknowingly relies on a large number of AI policies that amplify their legal and cultural infallibility.

--> In short, with Gnostic Warfare training, you will be able to identify AI dependencies that empower Antifa and manipulate them to reduce their legal protections and operational capacity.

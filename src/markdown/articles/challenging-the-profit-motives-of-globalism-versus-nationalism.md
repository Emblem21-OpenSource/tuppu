This is not a popular topic.  In most Western countries, this is not even a legal topic. Regardless of moral and political positioning, this is an inevitable topic.

The cabal responsible for the global industrial balance of production and consumption, powered by Saudi oil consumption, (which, in turn, is powered by [recycling petrodollars through British and United States banking systems](https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/mm_rs_03.htm) [which, in turn, is enforced upon OPEC oil producers by American military projection]) is fragmenting. The Russians have been involved in a [campaign ](http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Russia-The-King-Of-Arctic-Oil-By-Default.html)of [carving up](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/world/europe/in-taking-crimea-putin-gains-a-sea-of-fuel-reserves.html) and laying claim to [critical bottlenecks](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/74201) of oil consumption while [expanding their own oil exports to China](http://csis.org/publication/russia-china-gas-deal-and-redeal). The mythos of environmentalism, born in the 1960s, has evolved into an influential force, directing official policy in developed countries and the economic perception of their consumers to [bypass the cabal altogether](http://www.cfr.org/united-states/shale-gas-tight-oil-boom-us-states-economic-gains-vulnerabilities/p31568). Developing nations are asserting their own authority in regional matters via [land grabs](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/u-s-worried-chinas-land-grab/) and [nuclear proliferation](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-saudi-nuclear-idUSKCN0PV1GC20150721).  As I have told a friend at Credit Suisse eight years ago: “_We are entering a Neo-Alexandrian world_.”

Alexander of Macedonia wasn't a great leader because history says so.  Alexander managed to bind hundreds of tribes, each with their own language, ethos, culture, religion, and economic pressures, to his goal.  He carved a path from the Mediterranean to India ([and funneled nearly all of the gold from Mesopotamian antiquity into Europe](http://www.miningreece.com/mining-greece/mining-history/the-goldmines-of-alexander-the-great/)) in the world's first attempt at aggressive globalism.  His grand ambitions were dashed by simple human needs: _[His soldiers went on strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_campaign_of_Alexander_the_Great#Revolt_of_the_army), citing a desire to reconnect with loved ones and their increasing skepticism of Alexander and his willingness to blur cultural identities._

There have been [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road) [more ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire)[attempts ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire)[at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire) [globalism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire)[since ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire)[Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire), [all of which have subsequently reduced the emotional buy-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire) [required to accept the destruction of one's cultural identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_imperialism).  However, once the industrial age came to fruition, the ability to overcome previously insurmountable cultural squabbles became cheaper and easier, [mostly due to mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_radio).  With this technology, cultural perceptions could be homogenized across hundreds of millions of people, ensuring their economic actions were within a range of acceptable behavior.  However, with every increase in globalism, [there has been countercultural reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) [obsessed with restoring a primal understanding of identity that doesn't require years of education and propaganda to comprehend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism).  The high cost of normalizing globalist culture (perpetual reinvention of new communication mediums to create a generation's worth of authenticity) eventually hits diminishing returns because of this identity impulse.  It appears that human DNA has several million years of defenses to invoke emotionally convincing skepticism of mass identity destruction, despite the best intentions of the learned and the powerful.

Assuming that these unverified assumptions of human neurosociology are completely incorrect, we still live in a world where the elite [absolutely rely on the leverage provided by the labor arbitrage that only globalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_and_industrial_history_of_China) (and floating exchange rates) can provide. Take the European Union, for example. [ Each member of the European Union can print bonds in their nation's name](http://www.investinginbondseurope.org/Pages/LearnAboutBonds.aspx?folder_id=468), but they cannot print currency to pay the coupon of those bonds. Furthermore, these nations cannot raise their taxes to pay the coupon either, as they are high-tax socialist paradises, thus, any increase in taxes will cut directly into consumption, which directly affects their imports/export agreements.  There is only one way in which European nations can pay off these coupon: _labor arbitrage_.

Importing massive amounts of cheaper immigrants, especially in export-heavy nations like Sweden and Germany, is a conceit that Europe must now follow the American/Ford model of labor arbitrage: _Import labor to do that which is too complex to outsource, and then outsource the rest_. In short, Europe is engaging in a variation of Gresham's Law regarding labor: _Hoard complexity, liquefy simplicity_.  That means human organizations have a propensity to hoard those who can resolve complexity and expend those who are tasked to resolve simplicity.  The profits generated from cheap labor arbitrage will extend the politically popular (and expensive) socialist policies of human care that an export nation must provide to be competitive.  As gains in labor arbitrage occur, tax revenue increase, and stable bond issuance can increase to allow socialist nations to engage in production expansion. (Taxation being collateral) The loyal socialists who labored for years are replaced by a configuration of cheaper labor.  Their complaints and frustrations are dismissed as nothing more than racist reactions or tone deaf nationalism since the imported labor heralds from a variety of different races and/or nationalities.

The inevitable response to this automatic dismissal is populist nationalism.  To counter this evolution, the Americans have developed a very effective model in destroying populist nationalism when they engaged in their transition to global labor arbitrage back in the 1960s.  The American solution is that as long as those who benefit from the labor arbitrage (Fortune 500s, bond issuers, and Wall Street) are allowed to invest in and/or financially control media outlets, then nationalist impulses can be defused without unpopular and overt government heavy-handedness.  How?  In this setup, for-profit news and clickbait peddlers are driven by profit motive that undermines, waters down, harasses, lies about, and ultimately destroys countercultural nationalist upstarts.  This profit motive is very powerful and has achieved countless victories over the past ten years.

I will now going to give you the way to counter that profit motive.

During World War 2, the Europeans decided it would be hilarious if they blew themselves up.  As a result, they shipped most of their highly coveted gold to America, (the one place unscathed by the war) specifically, to the bedrock underneath Manhattan currently manned by robotic palate pushers owned by JP Morgan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  In fact, 98% of the gold owned by the Federal Reserve system is actually owned by Europe. (Over a thousand years of gold conquest led by Alexander, the Romans, the Conquistadors, and the Imperialists)  America has since refused multiple times to return this gold upon request to their various owners… while simultaneously pushing the narrative that gold is barbarous relic. (If it was so barbarous, why hold on to it so desperately, America?)  Because of this arrangement, there is a way to undermine the mass media anti-nationalism profit motive with the blessing of globalist overseers: Each European nationalist movement must strike multiple deals with the Federal Reserve.  When those nationalists come to power, they will enact quotas and legal changes to alter national import/export mechanisms, (driven entirely by Federal Reserve policy objectives) those European nationalists will be allowed to easily repatriate their gold to bypass and undermine Brussels currency issuance limitations.  In essence, European nationalism can be used to destroy the European Union with blessing from the Federal Reserve.

The _Neo-Alexandrian world_ I had mentioned in 2008 to my friend is one in which nationalism becomes more profitable to the individual nation than continued participation in globalism.  This model will achieve initial gains and advantages for first movers, leaving the remaining globalist bloc to operate without their full support.  This will profoundly affect global trade and, in desperation, second-tier members of the globalist bloc will nationalize, triggering in a cascade of nationalization for the remaining members.  The military and technological advantage of superstates and national unions will diminish as intelligence gathering will be made more expensive due to the subsequent regionalizations of the Internet, depriving the NSA and GCHQ of their current advantage.  Hundreds of tribes will return and we will be living in a world in which only an Alexander can understand and make sense of.

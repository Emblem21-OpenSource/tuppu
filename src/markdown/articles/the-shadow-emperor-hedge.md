--> The [Council on Foreign Relations ](http://archive.is/kRCk#selection-1445.0-1447.18)and [Goldman Sachs](http://archive.is/mxaxg#selection-779.0-779.14) have made their support of Hilary Clinton very clear.  [Google's search engine is trying to keep such support a secret](http://archive.is/8UkCy).  Saudi Arabia's massive influence over oil markets and petrodollar stability, however, doesn't give them the power to be overt in such support:

*   [Jordan's official news agency reported that Saudi Deputy Prince Mohammed bin Salman claimed Riyadh provided 20% of Hilary Clinton's election campaign.](http://archive.is/ibuaN#selection-2431.0-2431.371)
*   [The Podesta Group contacted the news agency, which responded with a claim that they were "hacked".](http://archive.is/ZVIlL#selection-843.0-843.229)
*   [Here is the FARA registration for the Podesta Group and the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court.](https://www.fara.gov/docs/5926-Exhibit-AB-20160122-71.pdf)
*   [Podesta Group was founded by Center for American Progress chairman and Bill Clinton's Secretary of Staff John Podesta.](http://archive.is/Xt8jP#selection-499.0-541.20)

--> From influential foreign policy think-tanks, to American tech monopolies, to Iron Age chieftains who controls the fate of post-Industrial currency, the prime movers of the world are backing Hilary Clinton.  This makes sense since these powers completely pocketed much of the liquidity freed up by [the Clinton's Pandora moment with repelling Glass-Steagall.  ](http://archive.is/3X81W#selection-2175.0-2193.117)And despite the massive surge of wealth Saudi Arabia and Google accumulated from this late 90s event, these two entities still fear being open about their support for Clinton.

--> Based on this this fear, I would like to propose an idea called the **_shadow emperor hedge_**.

--> Below is a chart providing a high-level view of the countries that spend the most on defense.

--> What we see is a very significant gap for other powers to spend as much as America does on defense.  This is mostly due to America controlling and protecting the interests of the reserve currency.

--> Next, I will point out that, with the passing of the Citizens United ruling, corporations are allowed to spend as much as they want to influence American elections.  [Saudi Arabia has made it very clear that clean energy technology and fracking are significant threats to its power.](http://archive.is/tnqNl#selection-943.128-985.107)  In fact, [they've already utilized Citizens United to funded opposition to Democratic and Republican senators in Missouri and Wisconsin.](http://archive.is/up5N2#selection-1403.0-1439.241)

To recap:

*   Tech companies such as Google that have benefited from the Glass-Steagall-powered dot-com bubble (Both in terms of market liquidity and competition elimination) should be expected to support the dynasties responsible for their success.
*   Asymmetrical tribal powers such as Saudi Arabia that have benefited from the War on Terror (both in terms of reasserting financial domination over the Middle East and in terms of eliminating other petrocurrency regimes) should be expected to support established institutional players.
*   Said tech companies should be expected to exploit their monopoly to demonstrate dynastic support.
*   Said tribal powers should be expected to utilize Citizens United to forge a more desirable American Senate.
*   [Said tech companies and their respective monopolies should be expected to be the primary beneficiaries of Citizens United as they accumulate insane profits during an election season.](http://archive.is/9v3tv#selection-1239.0-1239.209)
*   All involved agents are afraid of having their roles and motives regarding policy shifts being made public.

--> Thus, the _shadow emperor hedge_ can be summarized as,

_Foreign powers will utilize Citizens United to pay tech companies to steer the American electorate into supporting state policies that only benefit the foreign powers.  This allows a foreign power to achieve influence over their regional peers without having to increase defense spending since American military assets are steered via state policies._

--> As long as American military spending is geared towards reserve currency preservation, the marriage between foreign powers, tech media, and Citizens United will flourish.

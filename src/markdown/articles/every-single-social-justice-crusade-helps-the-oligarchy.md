--> **Redistribution of wealth** means to confiscate the assets of the weakest of the upper class (who are not savvy enough to buy legal protections against or bypass government force) into the lower classes so that they can spend their new-found income stream on the elite who dominate price controls.

--> **Multiculturalism** is a religion that teaches us that pre-Industrial non-Europeans are happy to work fourteen hour days in monotonous factory jobs or hard manual labor to produce cheap access to the basic goods that prop up post-Industrial European societies.

--> **Identity politics** is the modern tactic of "divide and conquer".  The local concerns of one powerless group that can be spun to be antithetic to the local concerns of another powerless group.  As long as the powerless groups believe this, they will never unify against a common enemy.

--> **Environmentalism** is the religion that only the West is wise enough to wield the power of industrial growth and everyone else is too greedy or short-sighted to consume their own resources.

--> **Equality** is a conservative religion that declares human beings to be equally interchangeable widgets/processes within an industrial context.  From this belief, creative efforts can be extracted from the human without having to acknowledge tribal impulses.  The end result is that the powerless manage their creative potential in relation to the industrial context, resulting in minimal administrative effort for the elite.

--> **Nationalized healthcare** is the theory that subsidizing the poor with taxpayer money so they can afford insurance means that insurance companies won't try to use the poor as human shields when they raise rates arbitrarily to access more taxpayer money.

Continental National Socialism is the organizational method that emerges from the confluence of Swiss banking influence, German export dominance, and the remnants of French and Dutch colonial power suckling off of British and American geopolitical activity.  This, of course, is not the widely held definition and for those who are not American, it's important to understand the American reactionary's love affair with what they perceive to be Continental National Socialism.

For our American reactionary "friends" (I.E.: The people we have to endure because we are all forced onto one planet), Continental National Socialism is believed to be a perfect utopia where all ills go away and people are magically endowed with rights and protections to live as carefree high-brow artists and critical thinkers forever.  This is not a recent belief.  This perception is a core tenet of American reactionary culture despite their insistence to change masks every ten years.

[The Euro Zone has slashed its corporate tax by 10% over the last ten years](https://archive.is/05mOY) which has helped fuel government debt to keep the socialism train going.  Throw in a 2008 world crisis and a few national bankruptcies a la Greece and what are you left with?  [You're left with an insidious and convoluted bailout-for-immigrant swap.](https://archive.is/FLaf1)

The British raised concerns over such ambitions from Brussels about six months ago on May 10th, 2015.  This warning was punctuated by the [Rotterdam rape storm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal)  The pro-feminism, pro-social justice media narrative has been working overtime to suppress the propagation of Rotterdam-like events.  They [have successfully refused to make any mention about the large volume of rapes by immigrants infecting Sweden ](https://archive.is/L9B7O)since a wave of military-aged Middle Eastern males entered their countries en masse.

[France has previously felt the sting of its future cheap labor supply in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_French_riots) and this week, they've felt it again.  They gave a silent nod to French Nationalist Marine Le Pen by shutting down their borders in response to recent terrorist attacks, but even this is just a dog-and-pony show.

[France is a protectionist organization that promotes political affiliates and union votes](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-15).  This arrangement will not be able to hold in the face of Brussels and their desire to implement the American labor model (_cheap immigrants for what cannot be outsourced_) across Europe.  [France has already seen the benefits of outsourcing government, defense, and manufacturing contracts](https://research.everestgrp.com/Product/ERI-2011-2-R-0541/Outsourcing-Landscape-in-France-Global-Sourcing-and-Service-Pr) and the time is coming to extrapolate this across their entire economy.

Bastions of Continental National Socialism such as France have relied on deep levels of union political integration since the end of World War 2.  However, the profit model such unions have relied on required post-war construction growth.   [That cannot compete against the model of wage stagnation and international labor arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_labor_arbitrage).  Muslim immigrants are essential for Europe's transition into wage stagnation, so not only are they the vanguard of injecting Islamic culture into Europe, they are also the front line of injecting American capitalism as well.

Through mass cheap labor, Europe will get the wage stagnation they desperately need to mitigate the previous period of socialist extravagance attached to Euro valuations.  This will transform the current European assisted class into a permanently semi-employed dependent class.  The nature of this dependency will be ideally expressed as ritual election season teeth-grinding as one generation of worker blends into a cheaper generation of worker.  However, that dependency presents opportunities to revitalize 1930s socialism via the nationalization of labor, [especially in countries that have few opportunities with international labor arbitrage](http://news.yahoo.com/hungarys-premier-rejects-immigration-multicultural-society-160801932.html).

The fall of Continental National Socialism has been passionately resisted by American reactionaries for their entire ideological livelihood.  It's almost a rite of passage among these types to say "_I wish we were more like Europe._"  As it turns out, they might get their wish after all.

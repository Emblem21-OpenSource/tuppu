summary: Tricking praetorians to over-rely on their social media panopticons

--> [My last post](http://cultstate.com/2017/10/13/The-Butterfly-War/) has created the desired effects.  [The intended first-order audience reacted correctly](https://archive.fo/XNuuN) and has began to experiment with cyber phrenology in a manner that will immensely destabilize the civil rights cornerstone of material humanism.  Many in the West will consider such experiments abhorrent, but they are no different than the cyber phrenology Silicon Valley has been doing for years.  It is fair to assume the intended second-order audiences (state actors, academics, and brand managers) who monitor the Chans will be incorporating the feasibility of the [Butterfly War's metadata insurgency](http://cultstate.com/2017/10/13/The-Butterfly-War/) into [their current metadata arsenal](http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ICIT-Brief-Metadata-The-Most-Powerful-Weapon-in-This-Cyberwar1.pdf).  For as long as Silicon Valley can [raise money](https://archive.fo/s7Qnw#selection-913.0-913.222) and [secure subsidies](https://archive.fo/4xaYR#selection-279.0-279.196), that kind of metadata insurgency will continue to metastasize until it completely consumes the crown jewel of Baby Boomer moral supremacy: *civil rights*.

--> [If something were to happen that could significantly interrupt the flow of investment into Silicon Valley](https://archive.fo/XLbGW), their reliance on [ad revenue would sharply increase, forcing Google and Facebook](http://fortune.com/2017/04/26/google-facebook-digital-ads/) to engage in the [most overt and insidious manifestations of cyber phrenology](http://archive.is/GTSbB).  As long as the Chans also engage in a variant of this activity, it will be easy for social justice advocates to emotionally demand the regulation of Silicon Valley, *the very financial engine that granted them political power to begin with*.  This self-sabotaging behavior is the purpose of the Butterfly War: **suppressing the Praetorian voice by hijacking their assets en masse**.

--> The Praetorian voice has enjoyed a prolonged influence over [cherished journalists](http://archive.is/JUapc), [abstract art](http://archive.is/PXkKo), [feminism](http://archive.is/AbblY) and other core institutions of material humanism.  [They have already sunk their teeth into memetic warfare](https://robotictechnologyinc.com/images/upload/file/Presentation%20Military%20Memetics%20Tutorial%2013%20Dec%2011.pdf) some time ago and hope to [bring it into their wheelhouse](http://archive.is/sM7Co).  This voice routinely weaves a false reality that promotes destructive military conquests to create endless supplies of cheap labor through displacement and migration.  If that voice can be suppressed for a time, then a core part of the cheap labor harvest cycle can be disrupted:

[![Real Cost of Humanism](/images/real-cost-of-humanism.png)](/images/real-cost-of-humanism.png)

--> Depriving a nation of cheap labor derived from warfare will create demand for an [alternative in the form of robotic labor](http://cultstate.com/2014/09/09/the-putin-short-and-the-drone-long-the-rise-of-petrocurrency-mercantilism/).  Without such feasts for the carrion, the [ravens will starve](http://archive.is/vtMsj#selection-105.12-105.104) long enough to irreversibly settle for that alternative.

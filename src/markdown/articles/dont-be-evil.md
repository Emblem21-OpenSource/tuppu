--> [This 30+ page technical slide deck](https://mega.nz/#!XtNm0CYL!I4_IfjOEkKwu2agf6nglfH7is13hgxSZDMa2Mfop1zM) explains how Google is able to leverage contemporary data science and machine learning to classify web sites, visitors, and advertisers based on contextual analysis.  It also explains how authoritative journalists, raters, blue checks, and narrative owners generate hit pieces, articles, and content designed to exploit Google's machine learning limitations.

--> Google has to continuously update their contextual associations to make sure their product can connect advertisers to potential consumers.  To do that, their systems require continual training from any new content or changes to content it discovers.  Google also provides "_authoritativeness_" to people and organizations to give them greater influence over the contextual associations Google forms.  If these authoritative actors all create their content in unison to make sureGoogle's machine learning establishes specific contextual associations, they efffectivel control search engine behavior, advertising and commercial opportunities, and future content creation.

--> [This 30+ page technical slide deck](https://mega.nz/#!XtNm0CYL!I4_IfjOEkKwu2agf6nglfH7is13hgxSZDMa2Mfop1zM) explains precisely how those journalists do that.

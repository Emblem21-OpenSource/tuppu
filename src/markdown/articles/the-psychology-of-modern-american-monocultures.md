--> [In previous posts](/2014/10/25/the-experiments-in-fracturing-monocultures/), I've discussed the organizational tactics embraced by the **imperial monoculture of pixel-based feminism**.  In this post, I will be discussing the _social psychology_ of its supplicants by briefly analyzing its demographics.

--> First things first, _let us debunk the myth that feminism is rooted entirely in the perspective and experiences of females_.  [Pinterest and Instagram are female-dominated websites](http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-and-social-media-demographics-2013-12?op=1):

*   Pinterest is dominated by tablet users.
*   According to Nielsen data, 84% of U.S. Pinterest users are women
*   Instagram is very female-oriented. 68% of Instagram's users are women.
*   Instagram is a mobile-only platform.

--> However, these sites are _not_ bastions of pixel-based feminism despite having such a massive female audience.  In fact, no serious identity reaction has ever emerged from the depths of these social hubs.  One might argue that the communication mediums and consumption purposes of those sites somehow prevent ideological debate, however, they having the same sharing, commenting, and subscription mechanisms as other social hubs.

--> If the _imperial monoculture of pixel-based feminism_ is not originating from social hubs where female creative participation absolutely dominates, then where is it coming from?  Let us look at three monoculture hotspots: **Tumblr**, **Twitter**, and **Reddit**.  [According to Wishpond](http://brandongaille.com/26-astonishing-tumblr-demographics-trends-and-stats/):

*   73% of Tumblr use desktops.
*   64.2% of users are American.
*   67% are under 35 and 32% are 18-24.
*   54% are female.

--> Now, let us look at Twitter:

*   [27% of users are 18-29](http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-and-social-media-demographics-2013-12?op=1)
*   [62% of users are female...](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/social-media-by-gender-women-pinterest-men-reddit-infographic_n_1613812.html)
*   [...yet huge followers of pro-feminist Tweeters are overwhelmingly male](http://readwrite.com/2014/09/03/twitter-analytics-demographics-gender-algorithm-male-female-followers#!). (Females do not follow each other because they are competing for male readership)
*   [The typical Twitter user is a 37 year old female](http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/21/report-social-network-demographics-in-2012/)
*   [75% of users are via mobile devices](http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/mobile-twitter-161m-access-from-handheld-devices-each-month-65-of-ad-revenues-coming-from-mobile/)  (This let's us  discount interfacing preferences within the monoculture)

And finally, [at Reddit](http://thepowertoprovoke.com/the-blog/2014/02/reddit-demographics-and-user-surveys.html):

*   78% of Redditors are male (This let's us discount gender as the primary influence of monoculture psychology)
*   49% of them are between the ages of 18-24
[Pingdom](http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/21/report-social-network-demographics-in-2012/)'s age/gender breakdown of various social media sites:

![](/images/social-network-average-age-580px.jpg)
![](/images/social-network-gender-distr-580px.jpg)

--> Do you see the pattern?  No?  Here is a clue:  **The 17-25 age range**.  _Using Pingdom's charts only_, we see:

*   &lt;~47% of all social media users are within this range.
*   &lt;~52% of Tumblr users fall in this range.
*   &lt;~45% of Twitter users fall in this range.
*   &lt;~58% of Reddit users fall in this range.

--> What happened 17-25 years ago?  It was 1990-1998 when these people were born and they all have one collective experience in common: _Their social awareness (starting usually at around the ages of 10-13) was formed within a **post-9/11 world**._

--> These people have only known socialization to be the act of **[perpetual war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_War_on_Terror#Co-opted_Feminism), [labeling all opposition terrorism](https://archive.today/B6vl9), and [desperately seeking safety above all other concerns](https://archive.today/qkwps).  To this age group:

*   Militarized police are normal because they ensure a safe space.
*   Massive multi-nation NSA wiretaps aren't a big deal because it ensures a safe space.
*   Privacy is problematic as, to ensure the safe space, all behavior and thoughts must be monitored.
*   Denouncing people you disagree with as terrorists is normal discourse.
*   Social media point systems are a part of self-image and maximizing those points is an imperative.

--> This generational influence, above all other factors, explains the origin of the psychological tendencies found within the [imperial monoculture of pixel-based feminism](/2013/08/14/the-theory-of-fracturing-monocultures/).  Anyone who creates content that appeals to these points will find a ready demographic to tap for ad revenue.  This cult psychology isn't about gender, ideology, or even politics**.**  **It's about socializing an entire generation to approve of heavy-handed suppression tactics**.

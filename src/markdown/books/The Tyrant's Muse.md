Epidemiology is the fusion of statistical analysis and bio-metrics to infer the causality of health conditions within a population.  It covers many fields of focus, from epidemic transmission to obesity rates to clinical trials for new drugs.  The phrase imposes a context of human infection, however, epidemiological analysis also applies to [livestock](http://ex-epsilon.slu.se:8080/archive/00000036/01/Widgren.pdf) and, as of late, [malware](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep05659) and [memes](http://www.sri.com/work/projects/meme-epidemiology).

Memetic epidemiology attempts to discover and map the transmission, retention, and provocativeness of an idea.  I will spend the rest of this article explaining why this is most dangerous technology mankind has ever dabbled with and how to completely destroy its effectiveness.

Firstly, we have to understand the transmission process.  I generate a symbol (A body motion, a spoken phrase, a written letter, etc.) and present it to you.  You consume this symbol and you will proceed to interact with it.  You can choose to dismiss the symbol, internalize it and have the symbol affect you unconsciously, (unresolved trauma, etc.) or you can externalize the symbol and keep it alive. (emit something funny, insightful, curious, distasteful, etc)  In any case, symbols alter the behavior of the symbol consumer.  Upon externalization, the symbol is transmitted to additional consumers who, in turn, go through that same process and react.  The process repeats over and over again, and thus, the symbol has a transmission property.  (_Similar to how a virus hijacks the mitosis process of a cell to turn it into a viral factory._)

Secondly, we have to understand retention.  The human mind is constantly taking in an inconceivable amount of information per second.  A single 75W light bulb emits 1.703 trillion photons per second and two eyes containing a paltry combination of 240 million rods, in which 12 million are able to construct the objects we observe.  We have a multitude of senses simultaneously pouring information into our brains and, miraculously, our brains can keep up without melting down .  As we see between the massive gap between trillions of photons and hundreds of millions of rods, the key to this strategy is not to retain all sensory information to the brain, but to filter, compress, and reject information.  A symbol has to pass through a rigorous filtration system of physical, emotional, social, and contextual processes and if it survives, it will be retained.  (_Similar to how a virus has to endure physical, chemical, and biological responses in order to establish a foothold._)

Finally, we have to understand the provocativeness property.  The vast majority of our lives are spent retaining fairly mundane information.  (_Body position when walking, "muscle memory" for basic typing/texting, where objects are located_) Occasionally, a symbol will come along and compel our behavior into specific action.  (_Outrage, adoration, sympathy, hatred, etc._) This is equivalent to the mortality of a viral infection: once the symbol dominates the consciousness, the infected will do exactly what the provoker of that symbol intended.

By understanding these properties, those who control information exposure and distribution have a very powerful tool in their arsenal.  By applying symbols/memes to the epidemiological context, such entities can create a mass response for specific actions of political expedience.  A meme can be intentionally created based on how previously measured demographics might respond, allowing the "_web of authority"_ to fabricate justification for actions that others would view as unaccpetable.

However, this system _also_ requires a massive surveillance system to measure each epidemiological property of a meme so that the web of authority can iterate and adapt. (_And emulate the mutation mechanisms that viruses utilize to evade immunological response_)

From Edward Snowden's revelation of mass domestic snooping to the censorious filter bubbles social justice warriors are obsessed with fabricating, the tool to measure the epidemiological lifecycle of a meme is firmly in place.  If you were asked to create a surefire way to ensure the anonymous transmission (and thus, eliminate the causality of the meme) of information between two people via the Internet, you wouldn't be able to do it and here's why:

In 2013, Edward Snowden released information about the astounding NSA involvement in undermining Internet privacy worldwide.  The world responded, not by clamoring for political solutions and formal protests, but [by embracing deeper privacy technology via Tor](https://archive.is/rcuOP).  As you can tell by the spike and subsequent re-normalization of Tor usage, privacy requires an adaptive discipline that most people aren't capable of. maintaining. Therefore, the discipline requirements to sustain the retreat into increasingly complex encryption and network topology_ cannot undermine the relationship between memetic epidemiology and the web of authority_.  As the faulty defensive discipline evolves, opportunities for additional mass surveillance appear which reinforces the supremacist narrative of mass surveillance.

Additionally, the silent hope that surveillance [ought to be a two-way street](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a2404/4237005/) feeds into the system of memetic epidemiology.  The regulation of Wall Street is a prominent example of the how to bypass the supposed benefits of two-way surveillance.  Their actions are heavily regulated by the SEC to ensure transparency and public involvement in nearly every action of an IPO.  Despite such monitoring, the 2008 bailouts proved that even in highly monitored situations, there are ways to hide intentions in plain sight ([using lowest common denominator moral smoke screens of giving housing to even those who don't qualify for loans](https://archive.is/KFwQZ)) to achieve good will among those who expected the American dream.  No sector is monitored in the public light like the financial sector, and yet, despite this supposed hindrance, that sector still manages to maintain significant influence over domestic, international, fiscal, and monetary policy.  Thus, the "_surveillance ought to be a a two-way street_" meme is a red herring designed to force detractors to conceit that mass surveillance is not only unstoppable, but preferable as long as an incalculable criteria of single standard is fulfilled.

The web of authority is able to measure their effectiveness via memetic epidemiology, not because they are able to afford the smartest of their field, but because the cost of surveillance has never been cheaper.  Once we understand the economics of surveillance, we can begin to understand that the only way to destroy any attempt to reduce our privacy is to increase the cost of surveillance.  In 2014, [Smári McCarthy made a rough approximation of what the web of authority pays for mass surveillance](https://archive.is/FmuhR#selection-17.0-17.14): _13 cents per person_.  Dramatically increasing this cost via McCarthy's proposed channels (legal, technical, personal discipline) will certainly undo mass surveillance in its current form.  This article is about exploring an additional and practical method of increasing these costs.

For example, if there programs that could change your identity at the operating system level at consistent intervals, (using programs that utilize seeding strategies to change the email addresses, contact information,  and additional personal identifies of millions of people to be the same information at the same time) then mass surveillance systems reliance on graph theory would completely collapse.  The price of surveillance would dramatically increase to the point of bankrupting the intelligence efforts of even the wealthiest of nations.
